# Introduction to Machine Learning
[Scikit Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/supervised_learning.html#supervised-learning)
## Navie Bayes
- Gaussian Naive Bayes
- Multinomial Naive Bayes
- Complement Naive Bayes
- Bernoulli Naive Bayes
- Categorical Naive Baye
- clf = GaussianNB()
## Support Vector Machines
- Classification
- Regression
- sklearn.svm.SVC(kernel='rbf', C=1.0, gamma='scale')
## Decision Trees
- Classification
- Regression
- DecisionTreeClassifier: min_samples_splitint or float, default=2
## Choose Algorithm
- k nearest neighbors: classic, simple, easy to understnd
- adaboot & random forest: 'emsemble methods', meta classifiers built from decision trees
### Process
1. do some research
2. find sklearn documenttion
3. deploy it
4. use it to make predictions
5. evaluate it accuracy
## Datasets and Questions
- Patterns
### Types of Data
- numerical - numerical values (numbers, e.g. salary)  
- categorical - limited number of discrete values (category, e.g. star of movie)
- time series - temporal value (date, timestamp)
- text - words
## Regressions
- Continous supervised learning
- Minimize sum of the squared errors (SSE)
1. Ordinary Least Squares
2. Stochastic Gradient Descent  
- r<sup>2</sup> (r squared)(0<r<sup>2</sup><1): how much of my change in the output (y) is explained by the change in my input  

Comparing Classification & Regression
| Property   |      Supervised classification      |  Regression |
|:----------|:-------------|:------|
| Output type |  Discrete (class labels) | Continous (number) |
| What are you tring to find | Decision boundary | "best fit line" |
| Evaluation | Accuracy | "Sum of squared error" or r<sup>2</sup>("r squared") |

## Outliers
- Ignore:
1. Sensor malfuntions
2. Data entries  
- Pay attention:
3. Freak event
- Removal strategy:
1. Train
2. Remove points with largest residual errors (10%)
3. Retrain
## Clustering
- K-means
1. number of clusters (default:8)
2. max_iter
3. n_init: run with different centroid seeds
## Feature Scaling
rescale = (x-x_min)/(x_max-x_min) (0,1)

MinMaxScaler() when the features have dramatically different quantities and large difference

These algorithms would be affected by feature rescaling.
1. SVM with RBF kernel
2. K-means clustering  

These algorithms would NOT be affected by feature rescaling.
1. Decision trees
2. Linear regression

## Text Learning
Stopwords, low information

-Term frequency: bag of words  
-Inverse document frequency: weighting by how often word occurs in the corpus

## Feature Selection
- Use human intuition
- Code up the new feature
- Visualize
- Repeat

Two big univariate feature selection tools in sklearn: SelectPercentile and SelectKBest. 
- SelectPercentile selects the X% of features that are most powerful (where X is a parameter) 
- SelectKBest selects the K features that are most powerful (where K is a parameter)

Lasso().fit(features, labels)  
Lasso().coef_
## PCA
Maximal Variance  
Retains maximum amount of information in original data  

- Systematized way to transform input features into principal components (PC)
- Use principal components as new features
- PCs are directions in data that maximize variance (minimize information loss) when you project/compress down onto them
- More variance of data along a PC, higher that PC is ranked
- Most variance/most information -> first PC  
  second-most variance (without overlapping w/ first PC) -> second PC 
- Max no. of PCs = no. of input features
## Validation
- Give estimate of performance on an independent dataset
- Serve as check on overfitting  
train_test_split(features, labels, test_size=0.3, random_state=42)
## Evaluation Metrics
[Confusion Matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confusion_matrix) (Row is true labels, column is predicted labels)  
- Recall: True Positive / (True Positive + False Negative) (Check the rows) (recall equals sensitive)
- Precision: True Positive / (True Positive + False Positive) (Check the columns)

- My identifier doesn't have great precision, but it does have good recall. That means nearly every time a POI shows up in my test set, I am able to identify him or her. The cost of this is that I sometimes get some false positives, where non-POIs get flagged.
- My identifier doesn't have great recall, but it does have good precision. That means whenever a POI gets flagged in my test set, I know with a lot of confidence that it's very likely to be a real POI and not a false alarm. On the other hand, the price I pay for this is that I sometimes miss real POIs, since I'm effectively reluctant to pull the trigger on edge cases.

[Receiver operating characteristic (ROC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic) curve: plotting the true positive rate (TPR) against the false positive rate (FPR) at various threshold settings. (Check the rows)  
- The true-positive rate is also known as sensitivity, recall or probability of detection in machine learning. The false-positive rate is also known as probability of false alarm and can be calculated as (1 âˆ’ specificity).
