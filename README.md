# Introduction to Machine Learning
[Scikit Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/supervised_learning.html#supervised-learning)
## Navie Bayes
- Gaussian Naive Bayes
- Multinomial Naive Bayes
- Complement Naive Bayes
- Bernoulli Naive Bayes
- Categorical Naive Bayes
## Support Vector Machines
- Classification
- Regression
## Decision Trees
- Classification
- Regression
## Choose Algorithm
- k nearest neighbors: classic, simple, easy to understnd
- adaboot & random forest: 'emsemble methods', meta classifiers built from decision trees
### Process
1. do some research
2. find sklearn documenttion
3. deploy it
4. use it to make predictions
5. evaluate it accuracy
## Datasets and Questions
- Patterns
## Regressions
- Linear Regression
## Outliers

## Clustering
- K-means
## Feature Scaling
