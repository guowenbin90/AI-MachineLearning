## Part 1: Initial results
Try to run the empty one first, it will generate the initial results.

python poi_id.py  
python tester.py
```
GaussianNB()
Accuracy: 0.25560	Precision: 0.18481	Recall: 0.79800	F1: 0.30011	F2: 0.47968
Total predictions: 10000	True positives: 1596	False positives: 7040	False negatives:  404	True negatives:  960

Q1: Summarize for us the goal of this project and how machine learning is useful in trying to accomplish it. As part of your answer, give some background on the dataset and how it can be used to answer the project question. Were there any outliers in the data when you got it, and how did you handle those?  [relevant rubric items: “data exploration”, “outlier investigation”]

**Goal:** To classify POI out of enron email dataset. Precision and Recall are greater than 0.3 at least.
